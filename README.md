# BattleShip

This project is to create a digital version of the popular board game known as battleships. Battleships is a two player game with 2 phases. In the first phase the player’s ships are placed on the board. In the second phase each player takes it in turns to select grid squares on the board in an attempt to find and destroy their opponent’s ships. Once one player has lost all of their ships the game is over and the player who still has ships on the board is the winner.
Each player has a number of ships including: 2 patrol boats (1 x 2), 2 battleships (1 x 3), 1 submarine (1 x 3), 1 destroyer (1 x 4) and 1 carrier (1 x 5).

There are a number of rules that players must follow. 
2 Ships cannot occupy the same space on the board. 
If a player scores a ‘hit’ on their opponent, then they get a second shot.
Ships cannot be moved once they have been placed.
